This is a project based on codeacdemy exercise: 'Find your Hat'
I may improve this more in the future but for now:

Its a game where you can move in order to find the hat '^' (the key) using node.js and console 
added basic logics like movement boundaries, win states and such.
This is mainly to strenghen my base JS.
